	  <h3>I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>, an Aspiring Software Engineer.</h3>
	  <h3>Long story short, I started college without knowing how to code. I felt in love with computer science after taking <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50</a> on my free time in my sophomore year. I decided gave up all of my engineering courses to pursue my true passion in computer science in my junior year.</h3>
	  <h3>It has been a fun ride. I interned at Macy's System and Technology for two semesters in 2016. I will be interning at <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">pagerduty</a> in the summer of 2017</h3>
