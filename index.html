	  <h3>I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>, a computer science major at <span style="color: #EEB211 !important">Georgia Tech.</span></h3>
	  <h3>Long story short, I started college without knowing how to code. I felt in love with computer science after taking <a style="color: #a51c30 !important" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50</a> offerred by Harvard in my free time in my sophomore year. I then decided gave up all my engineering courses to pursue my passion in computer science in my junior year.</h3>

	  <h3>My threads are information internetworks and systems &amp; architecture. I love learning things from the bottom up. Knowing how the computer works at the low level is cool. Knowing how the computers are connected all over the world is just cooler.</h3> 

	  <h3>It has been a fun ride. I interned at <a style="color: #c00 !important" href="https://www.macys.com/">Macy's</a> System and Technology for two semesters in 2016. I will be interning at <a style="color: #25c151 !important" href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a> in the summer of 2017.</h3>
