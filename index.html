	  <h3>I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>, a computer science at <span style="color: #EEB211 !important">Georgia Tech.</span></h3>
	  <h3>Long story short, I started college without knowing how to code. I felt in love with computer science after taking <a style="color: #a51c30 !important" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50</a> offerred by Harvard on my free time in my sophomore year. I then decided gave up all of my engineering courses to pursue my passion in computer science in my junior year.</h3>
	  <h3>It has been a fun ride. I interned at <a style="color: #c00 !important" href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">Macy's</a> System and Technology for two semesters in 2016. I will be interning at <a style="color: #25c151 !important" href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">pagerduty</a> in the summer of 2017</h3>
